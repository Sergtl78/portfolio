# Portfolio project

Here are my skills and examples of my work using TypeScript, React, Next and TailwindCss.

This project used and implemented:

- Portfolio created using TypeScript, React, Next.
- CSS using Tailwind.
- Light and dark theme are implemented using NextThemes.
- In two languages using i18n, you can easily add support for another language version.
- Animation using Framer Motion.
- Description of projects via .mdx files for easier editing.

Perhaps later this portfolio will develop into a blog.
